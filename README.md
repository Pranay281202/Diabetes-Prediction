# Diabetes-Prediction
We're using the KNN algorithm to predict if someone has diabetes or not, based on certain features. Diabetes happens when the body doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use it properly, causing high blood sugar levels. Over time, this can harm the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
People with diabetes are at higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, foot ulcers, and blindness. Simple lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy weight, being active, eating well, and not smoking can help prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.
Diabetes can be diagnosed early with blood sugar tests. Treatment involves a healthy diet, exercise, and controlling blood sugar levels. The KNN algorithm helps predict diabetes early, guiding people to prevention strategies and better health.
